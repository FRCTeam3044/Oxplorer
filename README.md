# NEW! Super Pathfinding Bros Wii
Don't mind the name. I'll get a more formal one later.

## Pathfinding
The pathfinding folder contains the actual pathfinding code. The main pathfinder file is kinda broken right now, but most of the core structures, a-star, and map file are fine (but undocumented).
## Server
We ran the rio one last season and its slow as dirt, so we had to offload pathfinding to a processor. The server folder the (very broken) implimentation of the communication I used.
## ExampleProj
A (unfinished) example of implimenting pathfinding into a real robot project
