# FRC Pathfinding
This repo will be transferred to [FRCTeam3044](https://github.com/FRCTeam3044) when I am done working on it. I have activley been working on it these past couple weeks, but I broke a few things so I haven't committed here yet.

## Pathfinding
The pathfinding folder contains the actual pathfinding code. The main pathfinder file is kinda broken right now, but most of the core structures, a-star, and map file are fine (but undocumented).
## Server
We ran the rio one last season and its slow as dirt, so we had to offload pathfinding to a processor. The server folder the (very broken) implimentation of the communication I used.
## ExampleProj
A (unfinished) example of implimenting pathfinding into a real robot project
